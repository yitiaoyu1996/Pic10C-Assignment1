the file is created to run a card game called 'siete y medio', which means seven and a half in English. 
This game is really similar with Blackjack 21. 
In this game, the player will be play with the dealer(the computer)
The player will have $100 to bet. 
Firstly, the player enters his bet, then draws a card randomly. Each card has a value:
As   	  Dos  	  Tres  	 Cuatro 	 Cinco 	  Seis  	 Siete 	  Sota  	Caballo	  Rey  
1	       2	     3  	     4	       5	      6	       7	     1/2	    1/2	    1/2
Based on the cards the player currently has, he can decide whether or not he wants to draw more cards. 
The closer he gets to 7.5, the more likely he will win. However, if the sum of his cards is greater than 7.5, 
then the player busts and automatically lose the game.
After the player finishes drawing cards, it is the dealer's turn. 
The dealer will continue drawing cards until he the sum gets to 5.5
Then we compare the two sums and decide who is the winner. 
The game stops when the player loses all of his money.
